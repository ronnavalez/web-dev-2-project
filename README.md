Started planning project November 10, 2024.
Finished most parts but never used GitHub.
Only started using github 4 days before submission.

Project continuation/upgrade from web dev 1 project. Friend wanted a basic website for their small construction company
Instead of using HTML for the contents, changed everything to .php 
Main focus of this project is the reviews section. Depends on what else is needed.


November 25, 2024 - Re-reading requirements for the assignment.
CRUD for logged in users and admin were done then realized that the admin part is only being done through backend.
